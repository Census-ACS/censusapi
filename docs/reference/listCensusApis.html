#&gt; 457 The Annual Business Survey (ABS) provides information on selected economic and demographic characteristics for businesses and business owners by sex, ethnicity, race, and veteran status. Further, the survey measures research and development (for microbusinesses), new business topics such as innovation and technology, as well as other business characteristics. The U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center conduct the ABS jointly for Science and Engineering Statistics within the National Science Foundation. The ABS replaces the five-year Survey of Business Owners (SBO) for employer businesses, the Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs (ASE), the Business R&amp;D and Innovation for Microbusinesses survey (BRDI-M), and the innovation section of the Business R&amp;D and Innovation Survey (BRDI-S). https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/abs.html
